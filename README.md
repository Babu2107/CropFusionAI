## How does it work ?



## Project Workflow
The project will follow the same approach as used in all ML project. We'll go through different stages of data collection,feature extraction,training and finally deployment of trained model.

- Data Collection
- Feature Extraction
- Model training & evaluation
- Deployment

## 👩‍💻To Run (Locally)

1. Git clone the project repository on your local system
```javascipt
git clone https://github.com/deepeshdm/CropFusionAI.git
cd CropFusionAI
```

2. Install dependencies in package.json
```javascipt
npm install
```

3. Deploy project on local server
```javascipt
npm start
```


## Improvements to make
- Optimizing the 3D model to reduce loading time.
- Training the ML models on a larger dataset to provide generalized results.
- Adding cache support to speed up output time.
